## What is LaF?
**LaF = Lite and Fast**<br>
Krunker.io isn't a very heavy game, but there are people who still struggle to get good performance due to a low-spec PC,
<br>
LaF is lite and isnt like other clients with bogged down heavy features. the goal of LaF is to solve that issue! LaF is built to give low-spec PC's
<br>
a chance at good performance in the game.

## How to install
1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/LaFClient/LaF/releases/latest).\
**Tip:** Download the file for your pc by referring the table, select accordingly

|   OS    | Architecture |            File Name            |
| :-----: | :----------: | :-----------------------------: |
| Windows |    64bit     |    LaF_Setup_Windows_x64.exe    |
|  macOS  |    64bit     |     LaF_Setup_macOS_x64.dmg     |
|  Linux  |    64bit     | LaF_Setup_Linux_x86_64.AppImage |

1. Run the file you downloaded.\
**Tip:** Even if your pc shows 'Windows protected your pc', don't worry. This program has no ransomware. Please press 'Run anyway' to continue the installation.

3. Follow the dialog.\
**Tip:** I don't recommend changing the set install path. But if you have to change it in for some reasons, you can change it.
